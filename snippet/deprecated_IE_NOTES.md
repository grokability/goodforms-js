# Various peculiarities of working with older versions of Internet Explorer (IE)

- activating form fields by using `type="email"` isn't supported in IE
- there are no notifications by default when using IE, you need to set your own onGood/onBad handlers. IE does not support html5 validation,
so the normal styling doesn't apply.
